# Rice-Leaf-Prediction
# Introduction:
Rice leaf, a vital component of the rice plant (Oryza sativa), is a crucial element in the world's agricultural landscape. These leaves play a significant role in the growth and development of the rice plant, which is a staple food for a large portion of the global population. Rice leaves are characterized by their long, slender shape and green color, and they are responsible for photosynthesis, a fundamental process that converts sunlight into energy and sustains the plant's growth. Additionally, rice leaves also serve as a key indicator of the plant's health and can provide valuable insights into its overall condition. The understanding of rice leaves are essential for maximizing rice production and ensuring food security for millions of people world-wide.

Rice plant is susceptible to diseases that may affect the quantity and quality of rice production. Detection of these diseases by the farmers will require a great knowledge about the various disease and how to identify them visually. Monitoring these diseases, their occurrences and frequencies are very important for early detection of the affected plants, their timely treatment, and most importantly, for planning future strategies to prevent the diseases to minimize the losses. CNN is an algorithm of deep learning techniques that has been successfully invoked for handling computer vision issues such as picture classification, object segmentation, and image analysis. CNN has been used to address the classification of Rice leaf diseases accurate detection and classification of rice leaf disease. The dataset provided contains 119 jpg images of disease-infected rice leaves. The images are grouped into 3 classes in 40:40:39 ratio based on the type of disease.

Bacterial blight: elongated lesions near the leaf tips and margins, and turns white to yellow and then grey due to fungal attack.

Brown spot: dark brown colored and round to oval shaped lesions on rice leaves.

Leaf smut: small black linear lesions on leaf blades, leaf tips may turn grey and dry.

# Problem Description:
The task involves classifying leaf images into one of three classes:

1.Bacterial leaf blight,

2.Brown spot,

3.Leaf smut.
